# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# version 0.5.1

New features

- Added parameter "surface" to plot.RSA. surface = "predict" (default) plots the predicted surface. This is the known behavior of the function. surface = "smooth" plots a 2d-smoothed surface of the raw data (employs the Tps function of the fields package).



# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
#  version 0.4

- first "public" release
- no known bugs


# Known Todos:
- axes labels in plot.RSA(type="3d") have the correct rotation for the default plot rotation, but they do not rotate with the plot.
